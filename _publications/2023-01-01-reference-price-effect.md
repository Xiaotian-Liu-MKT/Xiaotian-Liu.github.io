### Abstract
This study investigates how historical price lists, provided in online auction descriptions, influence ending prices. The research estimates and compares three theories of reference price effects: adaptation-level theory, range theory, and range-frequency theory. Contrary to previous findings, this study supports range theory, demonstrating that the maximum price on the historical list positively affects the auction's ending price, while the price range has a negative impact.

### Key Findings
1.  **Maximum Price Effect**: The maximum price shown on a historical price list has a significant positive influence on the final auction price, serving as a powerful upper-bound reference point.
2.  **Range Inhibition**: A wider price range in the historical list actually has a negative impact on the ending price, suggesting that high variance in past prices may undermine consumer valuation certainty.
3.  **Range Theory Support**: The results provide empirical evidence favoring Range Theory over Adaptation-Level or Range-Frequency theories in the context of online auction reference prices.

### Methodology
The research employs econometric modeling to analyze auction data, comparing the predictive power of three major reference price theories. It utilizes large-scale data from online auctions to estimate how different components of price history (min, max, mean, range) shift consumer willingness to pay.
