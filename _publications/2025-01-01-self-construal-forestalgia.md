### Abstract
Marketers often use narrative ads as a powerful tool to shape consumer attitudes. These ads deliver key messages through storytelling, but what makes a story effective in the eyes of the consumer remains largely unexplored. Using a Facebook field study and a series of four experimental studies, the researchers examined the interaction between the narrative's temporal type (nostalgia vs. forestalgia) and the characters' self-construal (interdependent vs. independent) on consumer attitudes. Drawing on regulatory focus theory and regulatory fit theory, they found that consumers prefer forestalgia (vs. nostalgia) narrative ads when characters are independent, whereas they prefer nostalgia (vs. forestalgia) narrative ads when characters are interdependent. This effect was mediated by narrative transportation, which enhanced consumers' attitudes toward the ad.

### Key Findings
1.  **Temporal-Construal Fit**: Consumers with an independent self-construal respond more positively to "forestalgia" (future-oriented nostalgia) narratives, while those with an interdependent self-construal prefer traditional "nostalgia" (past-oriented) narratives.
2.  **Narrative Transportation**: The mechanism driving this effect is narrative transportation; when the temporal type aligns with the character's self-construal, consumers become more immersed in the story.
3.  **Field Validation**: The effects were validated through both controlled experiments and a real-world Facebook field study, demonstrating high external validity.

### Methodology
The research employs a multi-method approach:
*   **Facebook Field Study**: Testing real ad performance across different consumer segments.
*   **Experimental Studies**: Four controlled experiments to isolate the interaction effect and test the underlying mechanism (narrative transportation).
