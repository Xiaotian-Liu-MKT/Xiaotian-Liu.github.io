### Abstract
This research investigates the effectiveness of robotic fundraisers in charitable giving contexts. While service robots are increasingly deployed to reduce costs, this study demonstrates that they may unintentionally attenuate moral self-awareness—the feeling of being observed and judged by a moral agent—thereby reducing charitable giving. Across multiple experimental studies, we find that when a robot (vs. human) solicits a donation, consumers feel less social pressure to conform to prosocial norms, leading to lower donation likelihood and amounts.

### Key Findings
1.  **Fundraising Effectiveness**: Robotic fundraisers generally lead to lower donation outcomes compared to human fundraisers due to reduced social presence.
2.  **Moral Self-Awareness**: The primary mechanism is moral self-awareness; humans act as "moral mirrors" that trigger self-evaluation, a process that is significantly weakened when interacting with a robot.
3.  **Managerial Implication**: Non-profits should be cautious when replacing human fundraisers with robots, as the cost savings may be offset by a substantial drop in donation revenue.

### Methodology
The research employs a series of controlled experiments where participants interact with either human or robotic agents in donation scenarios. We measure donation behavior, perceived moral self-awareness, and social pressure to establish the causal chain.
