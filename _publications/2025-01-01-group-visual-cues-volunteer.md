### Abstract
This research explores how group visual cues in volunteer recruitment materials influence potential volunteers' intentions. Depicting volunteers in a group setting (vs. alone) can significantly boost recruitment effectiveness by activating "anticipated effervescence"—the expectation of collective joy, energy, and social connection. Across several studies, we demonstrate that this anticipated collective experience is a powerful motivator for prosocial behavior, particularly in community-based volunteering.

### Key Findings
1.  **Visual Framing**: Recruitment ads featuring groups of volunteers lead to higher click-through rates and sign-up intentions than those featuring a single volunteer.
2.  **Psychological Mechanism**: The effect is mediated by anticipated effervescence; potential volunteers are drawn to the promise of shared emotional energy.
3.  **Contextual Boundary**: The group effect is most prominent for events that are inherently social or community-focused.
