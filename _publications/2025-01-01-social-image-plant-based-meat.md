### Abstract
This study examines the role of social image in driving purchase intentions for plant-based meat alternatives. We find that consumers are increasingly motivated by how their dietary choices reflect their social identity. Specifically, when consumers perceive that purchasing plant-based meat enhances their social image—as someone who is environmentally conscious, innovative, or health-oriented—their purchase intention increases significantly. The research highlights the transition from functional consumption to self-expressive consumption in the sustainable food sector.

### Key Findings
1.  **Social Signaling**: Purchase intentions for plant-based meat are strongly influenced by the perceived positive signaling effect on one's social image.
2.  **Identity Alignment**: The effect is most pronounced among consumers who highly value their environmental or health-conscious identities.
3.  **Marketing Strategy**: Recommends that marketers shift from purely functional messaging (taste/texture) to identity-based messaging that emphasizes the social rewards of sustainable choices.

### Status
Major Revision (1st Round) at *Food Quality and Preference*.
