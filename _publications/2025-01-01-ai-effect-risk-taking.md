### Research Overview
This research demonstrates the "AI Effect," where exposure to news and information about artificial intelligence advancements leads to increased financial risk-taking. Using a staggered difference-in-differences approach with secondary data, we find that societal-level awareness of AI breakthroughs correlates with more aggressive investment behaviors. We are currently conducting experimental validation to further establish the psychological mechanisms.

### Status
Secondary data analysis complete; experimental validation in progress.
