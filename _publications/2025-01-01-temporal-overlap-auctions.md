### Research Overview
This paper investigates how overlapping end times for multiple auctions of similar items affect consumer behavior and bidding strategies. We demonstrate that while temporal overlap can create a sense of competitive urgency, it paradoxically undermines consumer valuation certainty. Bidders faced with simultaneous price signals from multiple auctions experience cognitive overload, leading to less precise valuations and potentially lower overall revenue for sellers.
