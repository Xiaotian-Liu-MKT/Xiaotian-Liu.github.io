**[PhD Dissertation Paper]**

### Abstract
This paper examines how communication styles alleviate consumer embarrassment in sensitive service encounters (e.g., purchasing medication or personal care products). We demonstrate that polite communication—characterized by acknowledging the consumer's presence with warmth and professional courtesy—outperforms minimal interaction in reducing embarrassment. Furthermore, this effect is moderated by the service agent type (human vs. robot), where the benefits of polite communication are more pronounced with human agents.

### Key Findings
1.  **Politeness Effect**: In embarrassing service contexts, consumers feel significantly less self-conscious when the service provider uses polite, warm communication compared to a purely transactional, minimal interaction.
2.  **Agent Moderation**: While polite robots are appreciated, the reduction in embarrassment is strongest when the polite communication comes from a human agent, highlighting the unique role of human empathy and social validation.
3.  **Communication Strategy**: Identifies communication style as a low-cost, high-impact tool for service providers to manage sensitive consumer emotions and enhance the service experience.

### Methodology
The research utilizes an experimental design where participants are randomly assigned to different service scenarios (embarrassing vs. routine) and communication styles (polite vs. minimal). We measure self-reported embarrassment, perceived warmth, and service satisfaction.
