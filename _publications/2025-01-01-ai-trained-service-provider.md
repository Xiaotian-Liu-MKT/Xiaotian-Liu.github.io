### Research Overview
This research explores consumer resistance to service providers whose expertise is explicitly attributed to AI training. We find that consumers are less likely to trust and value service providers when they believe the provider's skills were acquired through AI-led training rather than traditional human experience. The primary barrier is a perceived lack of "tacit knowledge"—the nuanced, experience-based intuition that consumers believe AI cannot yet replicate or instill in humans.
