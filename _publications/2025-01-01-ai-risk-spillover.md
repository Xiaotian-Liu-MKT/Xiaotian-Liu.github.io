### Research Overview
This project explores the "AI Risk-Spillover Effect"—the phenomenon where delegating tasks or interacting with AI systems leads to increased human risk-taking in unrelated domains. We hypothesize that the perceived safety and efficiency of AI create a psychological buffer, making users more comfortable with risk in their own decision-making processes.

### Status
Data collection phase; target: *Information and Management*.
