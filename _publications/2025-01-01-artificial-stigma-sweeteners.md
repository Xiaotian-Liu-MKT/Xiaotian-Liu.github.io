### Research Overview
This study examines the "artificial stigma" associated with non-nutritive sweeteners and how this perception taints the desirability of the entire product. We demonstrate that the presence of artificial sweeteners can lead to negative spillover effects, where consumers perceive other (even natural) ingredients as lower quality or less desirable. This research has significant implications for food marketing and product labeling strategies.
