At the UQ Business School, I lead tutorials for both undergraduate and postgraduate cohorts, focusing on bridging the gap between marketing theory and digital practice.

### MKTG3506 Digital Marketing and Social Media
*   **Course Objective**: Equipping students with the strategic and tactical skills needed to manage digital presence, from SEO/SEM to social media engagement.
*   **Key Topics**: Digital consumer journey, search engine optimization, paid search advertising, and social media analytics.
*   **AI Integration**: I introduced **AI-Driven Simulations** where students use generative AI to draft campaign content and then analyze the potential performance using simulated data. This approach allows for rapid prototyping and iterative learning of content strategy.

### MKTG7510 Market & Consumer Research
*   **Course Objective**: Teaching advanced postgraduate students how to design, execute, and analyze research to solve real-world marketing problems.
*   **Key Topics**: Experimental design, survey methodology, and quantitative data analysis (SPSS/R).
*   **Innovation**: Implemented **Automated Data Collection** modules where students learn to use basic Python scripts and AI tools to gather consumer sentiment from public digital platforms, enhancing their data literacy.

### Teaching Innovations & Tools
*   **AI-Enabled Pedagogy**: Beyond course content, I use AI tools to provide personalized feedback at scale and to generate diverse case study scenarios that reflect current industry challenges.
*   **Tools & Platforms**: Google Analytics 4, Qualtrics for advanced survey design, SPSS/SAS for statistical modeling, and custom HTML/JS simulations for experiential learning.
*   **Student Success**: Successfully supported large postgraduate cohorts (200+ students) through complex analytics projects, consistently achieving high student satisfaction ratings.
