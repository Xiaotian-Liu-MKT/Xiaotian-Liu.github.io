### Problem
Conducting large-scale behavioral experiments with human participants is costly and time-consuming. Researchers often need to iterate on experimental designs many times before reaching a final version that effectively tests their hypotheses.

### Solution
**GPT-as-Participants** is an AI-driven platform that uses Large Language Models (LLMs) as synthetic participants for rapid prototyping of behavioral experiments. It allows researchers to simulate consumer responses to various experimental manipulations (e.g., different ad copies, service agent types, or pricing strategies) at a fraction of the cost and time.

### Key Features
*   **Persona Simulation**: Define detailed consumer personas (demographics, self-construal, etc.) for the AI agents.
*   **Rapid Iteration**: Test and refine experimental materials in real-time.
*   **Prompt Engineering**: Employs advanced chain-of-thought prompting to elicit more nuanced and realistic responses.
*   **Statistical Analysis**: Generates synthetic data that can be analyzed using traditional statistical methods.

### Tech Stack
*   **Language**: Python
*   **AI Models**: OpenAI GPT-4o, Llama 3
*   **Framework**: Custom behavioral simulation engine

### Research Application
This tool was used in the early stages of my dissertation projects to refine the communication styles and service agent manipulations used in the final human experiments.
