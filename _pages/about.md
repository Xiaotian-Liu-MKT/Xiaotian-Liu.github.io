My research examines how emerging technologies (e.g., **AI**, **service robots**, and **digital platforms**) shape consumer decision-making and **prosocial outcomes**, with a particular interest in translating behavioural theory into data-driven marketing practice that delivers actionable managerial implications.

My PhD dissertation comprises two papers unified by a focus on **consumer self-conscious emotions** in service contexts: the first examines how communication styles alleviate consumer embarrassment in sensitive service encounters, identifying service agent type (human vs. robot) as a key boundary condition; the second demonstrates that robotic fundraisers attenuate moral self-awareness, thereby reducing charitable giving.

My future research agenda extends to the role of **AI in digital marketing, services, sustainability, and prosocial marketing**, aiming to provide insights that directly inform industry practice and enhance consumer wellbeing and societal outcomes. I primarily employ experimental designs, including **social media field experiments**, complemented by skills in econometric analysis, Bayesian modeling, and biometric methods. I also integrate **AI-enabled tools** into my teaching practice, preparing students for data-driven marketing careers.
