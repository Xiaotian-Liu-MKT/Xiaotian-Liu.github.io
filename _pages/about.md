I am a PhD candidate in Marketing at The University of Queensland. My research examines how emerging technologies (AI, service robots, and digital platforms) shape consumer decision-making and prosocial outcomes, with a focus on translating behavioral theory into data-driven marketing practice.

Research themes
- AI and service interactions
- Consumer self-conscious emotions in sensitive service contexts
- Prosocial marketing and charitable giving
- Digital marketing and social media field experiments

Current work includes two dissertation papers on embarrassment and guilt in service contexts, plus projects on AI-driven risk taking and social image in consumption.
