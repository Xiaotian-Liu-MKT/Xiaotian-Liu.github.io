## Research Profile
My research examines how emerging technologies (e.g., AI, service robots, and digital platforms) shape consumer decision-making and prosocial outcomes, with a particular interest in translating behavioural theory into data-driven marketing practice that delivers actionable managerial implications.

My PhD dissertation comprises two papers unified by a focus on consumer self-conscious emotions in service contexts: the first examines how communication styles alleviate consumer embarrassment in sensitive service encounters, identifying service agent type (human vs. robot) as a key boundary condition; the second demonstrates that robotic fundraisers attenuate moral self-awareness, thereby reducing charitable giving.

My future research agenda extends to the role of AI in digital marketing, services, sustainability, and prosocial marketing, aiming to provide insights that directly inform industry practice and enhance consumer wellbeing and societal outcomes. I primarily employ experimental designs, including social media field experiments, complemented by skills in econometric analysis, Bayesian modeling, and biometric methods. I also integrate AI-enabled tools into my teaching practice, preparing students for data-driven marketing careers.
